# socialNetworkAPI
## Description
### Project purpose was to use mongoDB and mangoose to build an API for a social network app. Users would be able create list of friends and share thoughts and reactions with friends. 
## User
### User should be able to run the app through node server.js and use insomnia to view data. User should be able to add, delete, and update data as well (such as adding a user, deleting a user, reacting to a freinds thoughts, etc)
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and Visual Studio Code was used to create code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make new JS files and follow the MVC to create model and routes folders as well. If there is starter code, the folders should be copied onto your own repository and mongodb and mongoose packages should be installed along with express follwoign the nmp i "name of package" format. Once all is installed, start coding and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Terminal" when you right click on the JS file and use insomnia to view data and manipulations to the data.
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. 
### Screencastify was also used in recoridng a walk-through demostration of the socialNetworkAPI.
